          <h3>Messaging</h3>
          <p>
            I use narrative visualization to better present the data changed among those three countries' covid-19 cases
            comparison. The narrative visualization helps researchers to find out the pattern of the virus spreading and
            the spreading speed among these countries. The general idea that I present is the correlation between the
            timeline and the 7-day average cases from United States, United Kingdom and India, from Jan, 2020 to Jul,
            2021.

          </p>

          <h3>Narrative Structure</h3>
          <p>I choose an <strong>interactive slideshow</strong> to present this data visualization. On the navigation
            bar, click the Visualization tab, then it directs to my visualization page.<br /> Under the header, there
            are three tabs and each tab can show a scene of the country-to-country comparison in Covid-19 cases. Each
            scene focuses on the different topics of the story. <strong>Besides</strong>, I made the feature that users
            can freely pick up the <strong>country</strong> name to see the data from that country. That gives users the
            opportunity to explore the scene. <strong>Moreover</strong>, I add the features such as
            <strong>tooltip</strong> and <strong>interactive legend</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Visual Structure</h3>
        <p><strong>Firstly</strong>, I use connected scatterplot as my scenes to present the Covid-19 cases data.
          <strong>Secondly</strong>, for each line on the scatterplot is represented a country's data, and I add a
          feature that can hide or show the line. That can help the users to select their interested country data.
          <strong>Thirdly</strong>, I use a dynamic visualization in annotations and scatterplot chart, which much
          improved the user experience in explore the story.
        </p>


        <h3>Scenes</h3>
        <p>There are three scenes. The <strong> first</strong> scene is the cases comparison between United States and
          United
          Kingdom, which can reflected the difference in cases number and peak value between US and UK. We can see the
          obvious difference that US had much higher peak than UK. However, we can see the peak date is very closed for
          the two countries. The <strong>second</strong> scene is about the comparison between United States and India,
          because this scene can better show the Delta variant impact on India, even US got higher peak than UK,
          however, the India peak was 1.5 times than US. That can prove that the Delta variant has extremely infectious.
          The <strong>last</strong> scene is about the after pandemic, three countries' comparison, which show the
          vaccination great impact. </p>


        <h3>Annotations</h3>
        <p> I use the annotation class to manage all the annotations in different scenes in the stepper.css file, I
          design the color, margin, font-size to modify those annotations in the similar style, that can be considered
          as the "format". I think the advantage of the format is better to read and easy to recognize without any
          confuse. Yes, the annotation is used to support the messaging, the annotations points out the feature of each
          scene and help users to figure out the story path. The annotation can be changed in different steppers.
          Because each stepper has different topics.</p>


        <h3>Parameters</h3>
        <p> There are several parameters in the narrative visualization, they are the country parameter and the date
          parameter. The 7-day average variable is the states and controlled by the country parameter and date
          parameter.<br />

          Firstly, the scatterplot is presented by the country parameter and the date parameter. Secondly, when the
          scene parameter changed, country parameter will make the related the states of cases changed      simultaneously. Thirdly, there is interactive legend feature. when the country name filter is selected, the
          states value can be hidden or shown up in the scene.
        </p>


        <h3>Triggers</h3>
        <p>For the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization, there are 3
          different ways: the stepper of each scene, the interactive legend and the tooltip.<br />
          The user can choose either to hover the cursor to the any datapoint, or changed the scene parameter to get the
          exploration for the story, or use interactive legend to choose any country interested in. </p>
